<p>Spider-Man in film dates back to 1977, the rights belonging to Marvel until 1999, when Sony bought them <br>
    for $7 million.[1] He has been Marvel's most successful character in the cinema industry ever since.<br>
     After selling the Spider-Man motion picture rights to Sony, Marvel eventually founded its own studio,<br>
      developing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) based on the characters they still held the rights to.<br>
       This would change in 2016, when Sony and Disney[2] entered an agreement to include Spider-Man in the<br>
        MCU. Despite some disagreements pertaining to finances and merchandising between the two parties, the<br>
         agreement proved to be a successful endeavor for both companies. The following two Avengers sequels<br>
         , finally with Spider-Man, crossed the two-billion-dollar mark at worldwide box office for the first<br>
          time. Meanwhile, Sony in association with Marvel[3] launched the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), <br>
          with Sony entering a three-billion-dollar streaming agreement with Netflix and Disney.[4]</p><br>
