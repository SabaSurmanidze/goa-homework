#Create a list named numbers that contains the integers from 1 to 10.

#Use list slicing to create a new list named first_half that contains the first five elements from numbers. # type: ignore

#Use list slicing to create another list named second_half that contains the last five elements from numbers.

#Use a list comprehension to create a new list named squares that contains the squares of each

#number in the numbers list.

#Print all three lists: first_half, second_half, and squares.
