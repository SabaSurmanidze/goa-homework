#Create a list named temperatures that contains the following values representing daily temperatures: 
# [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71].

#Calculate and print the highest temperature using the max() function.

#Calculate and print the lowest temperature using the min() function.

#Calculate and print the average temperature using the sum() function divided by the length of the list.

#Use a list comprehension to create a new list named above_70 that contains only the temperatures above 70 degrees.

#Print the above_70 list.


temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 78, 74, 71]
print(max(temperatures))
print(min(temperatures))
print(sum(temperatures))
above_70 = [71,80,90,100]
print(above_70)
